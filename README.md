# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try and get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game includes features such as tracking the winner, detecting draws, and allowing players to start a new game or reset the current game.

## Features

- Interactive game interface with clickable buttons representing the game grid.
- Player turn indicator to show whose turn it is (X or O).
- Detection of winning combinations and announcement of the winner.
- Detection of draws when all spaces on the grid are filled.
- Option to start a new game or reset the current game.
- Simple styling for a visually appealing user interface.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any of the empty squares to make your move.
3. The game will alternate between X and O symbols for each player's turn.
4. The game will announce the winner if a player gets three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or announce a draw if all squares are filled.
5. Use the "New Game" button to start a new game or the "Reset Game" button to reset the current game at any time.
